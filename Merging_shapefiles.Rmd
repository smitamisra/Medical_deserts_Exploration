This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(readr)
library(tibble)
library(ggmap)
library(sf)

```


```{r}
TN_census_tract <- st_read('data/tl_2021_47_tract/')
```

```{r}
US_census <- read_csv('./data/US_census.csv')
```

```{r}
#making a TN file
tn <- US_census[68680:70380,]
tn
```

```{r}
#making the GEOID column so that the shape fie can be merged with census
#1400000US47001020201

library(stringr)
tn$GEOID <- tn$Geo_ID%>%
  str_extract_all("US(\\d+)")%>%
  str_extract_all("(\\d+)")
  

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
